# Alternate Timeline Story Template

## Description

Welcome to the Alternate Timeline Story Template repository! This repository provides an easy-to-use template for creating alternate timeline story content using Twee and SugarCube. It is designed to simplify the process of developing interactive, multi-path stories and games.

For detailed information on SugarCube and its capabilities, please refer to the [SugarCube documentation](https://www.motoslave.net/sugarcube/2/docs/).

## Setup

To set up Twine on your local system, follow the instructions provided in the [Twine Documentation](https://twinery.org/).

## Folder Structure

- **audio/**: Contains all audio files used in the story. These files are open source and obtained from various sources. Feel free to replace them with your own content as needed.
- **images/**: Contains all image files used in the story. These files are open source and obtained from various sources. Feel free to replace them with your own content as needed.
- **TwineStoryFile.twee**: This is the main Twee file that contains all the passages and code for the story. Import this file into a Twine interface to edit and expand your story.
- The CSS file embedded in the story allows you to control all the styling and visualization aspects of your story, such as fonts, image sizes, button appearances, mouse actions, etc.

## How to Use

1. **Import the Twee File**: Import the `TwineStoryFile.twee` file into your Twine interface. This file contains the core structure of your story, including all passages and code.
2. **Customize the Content**: Edit the passages, code, and any other content to fit your story.
3. **Update Media Files**: Replace the audio and image files in their respective folders with your own content as needed.
4. **Style Your Story**: Use the `style.css` file to customize the appearance and behavior of your story elements.
5. **Export to HTML**: Once you make your changes, export to an html file similar to the sample `Application.html` in the repo
